    action: `
    An opportunity arose in 2009 to improve Chifley Tower’s energy rating (NABERS) from 0.5 stars to 4.5 stars through a sustainability upgrade project (Phase 1). 
    <br/>Key goals were as follows:  
    <li>• To maintain the reputation and value of Chifley Tower. Both tenants and investors were looking at the green rating of buildings as an important criterion for decisions.</li>
    <li>• The project was considered defensive in nature as it served as a protection against possible declining rental income, physical obsolescence and value deterioration, which would have been inevitable if the property had not kept up with competition in a soft office market.</li>
    <li>• Government agencies would have reportedly only leased space with at least a NABERS energy rating of 4.5 stars. Committing to achieve a NABERS 4.5 stars for Chifely Tower fulfilled GIC RE’s immediate primary objective to ensure that our properties would be certified to a standard generally fulfilling the requirements of potential tenants from both government and private sectors.</li>
